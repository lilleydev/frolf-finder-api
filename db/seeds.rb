# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# san_diego = Location.create(city: "San Diego", state: "CA", country: "US")
# kit_carson = san_diego.courses.create(name: "Kit Carson", street: "3333 Bear Valley Pkwy", city: "Escondido", state: "CA", difficulty: 6, mixed_use_park: true)
# brengle_terrace = san_diego.courses.create(name: "Brengle Terrace", street: "1200 Vale Terrace", city: "Vista", state: "CA", difficulty: 9, mixed_use_park: true)
# frontier = san_diego.courses.create(name: "Frontier", street: "1400 Mitchell", city: "Tustin", state: "CA", difficulty: 4, mixed_use_park: true)
# bj = User.first
